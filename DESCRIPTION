Description: Box-constrained multiobjective optimization using the 
        elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II.
        Fast non-dominated sorting, crowding distance, tournament 
        selection, simulated binary crossover, and polynomial 
        mutation are called in the main program. The methods are 
        described in Deb et al. (2002) <doi:10.1109/4235.996017>.
